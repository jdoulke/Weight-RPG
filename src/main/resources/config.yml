# Messages can support placeholders. List of placeholders
# %playername% for player's name.
# %displayname% for player's display name.
# %weight% for player's weight.
# %maxweight% for global max weight. (if you have enabled level 3 then level 3 is the maximum if you have disabled level 3 but enabled level 2 then level 2 is the max.)
# %world% for player's world.
# %level1% for weight level 1 value %level2% for level 2 and %level3% for level 3.
# %percentage% for weight percentage (weight * 100 / max weight)
# %percentageweight% for percentage animation.
# %pluginprefix% for plugin's prefix.
